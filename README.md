## Overview

**Nevermore** is an App for writers to meet, share, compete, and inspire one another as well as host collections of their own creations. It was developed with the intention of giving writers a dedicated and safe place to hone their craft and receieve constructive feedback.

## MVP

The **Nevermore** MVP includes: 

#Server (Back End)
- Build a Ruby on Rails server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
- Build database with at least 2 tables:
  - With at least 1 association between both tables. 
- Utilize Rails to define models for interacting with the database.
- Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (index, show, create, update, delete) between non-User tables.

#Client (Front End)
- Have a working, interactive React app.
- Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
- Utilize functional or class React components appropriately.
- Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
- Use only React for DOM Manipulation.
- Consume data from created Ruby on Rails API, and render that data in components.
- Utilize React Router, for client-side routing.
- Demonstrate Full CRUD actions ( index, show, create, update, and delete ) on the front end.

#Styling (Front End)
- Be styled with CSS (or SCSS, if you'd prefer).
- Use Flexbox or Grid in your layout design.
- Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop).

<br>

### Goals

- Establish a fully working Ruby on Rails Back End for MVP functionality.
- Establish a link between React front end with back end to display data.
- Create an alluring and fun UI/UX for users.
- Polish the app for availability on multiple screens.
- Create a User Authentication and Verification process.
